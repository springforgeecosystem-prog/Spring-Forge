# Architecture-Aware Anti-Pattern Classification Model

This repository contains the **Architecture-Aware Anti-Pattern Classification Model** developed as part of the research project:

**AI-Driven Code Quality Spring Boot Assurance Engine (IDE Component)**

The model focuses on detecting **code and architectural anti-patterns** in Spring Boot applications by incorporating **architectural context awareness** during static analysis and machine learning classification.

## 🎯 Research Objective

Traditional anti-pattern detectors treat code smells in isolation.
This work introduces an **architecture-aware approach** that:

- Considers architectural layers (Controller, Service, Repository, Domain)
- Detects anti-patterns with respect to architectural violations
- Improves detection accuracy for large-scale Spring Boot projects

## 🧠 Component Scope

This repository currently covers:

- ✅ Architecture-aware anti-pattern detection
- ❌ Code Quality Score Regression Model (to be developed later)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture-Aware Anti-Pattern Detection Pipeline
